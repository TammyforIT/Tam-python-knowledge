    "To work on this project you must first configure your `ds` conda environment by following the listed steps below. By the end of these steps, you will have a functioning environment that contains your hidden API key. Please follow these instructions closely or your project will not function correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Activate your conda environment via the following terminal command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate ds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Confirm that you see the `(ds)` prompt at the beginning of your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Once you've confirmed that you are in your environment, set your given API key to a conda environment variable using the terminal command below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env config vars set OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_api_key\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Deactivate and reactive your environment by running the following commands in your terminal\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda deactivate ds\n",
    "conda activate ds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Next, install the `openai` package by running the following pip command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Activate your kernel and run the code-block below to verify that you've successfully installed the `openai` package."

Then, work through hands-on projects with real datasets (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI) to practice cleaning, visualizing, and modeling data. Supplement this with a few targeted online courses or certificates (like Google’s Data Analytics or IBM’s Data Science Professional Certificate). Try to connect your biology background by analyzing biological or health-related data to build a portfolio that shows off both your domain knowledge and new technical skills.\""
